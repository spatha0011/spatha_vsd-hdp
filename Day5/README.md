# VSD Hardware Design Program

## Day 5 : VSDBabySoC Design and Modeling

VSDBabySoC is a small SoC including PLL, DAC, and a RISCV-based processor named RVMYTH.

### Introduction to the VSDBabySoC
VSDBabySoC is a small yet powerful RISCV-based SoC. 

The main purpose of designing such a small SoC is to test three open-source IP cores together for the first time and calibrate the analog part of it. 

VSDBabySoC contains one RVMYTH microprocessor, an 8x-PLL to generate a stable clock, and a 10-bit DAC to communicate with other analog devices.
