### `ASIC Flow`

VLSI, or Very Large-Scale Integration, is a cornerstone technology driving the modern world, silently powering the devices we rely on daily. Its importance stems from its profound impact on various aspects of our lives, making it ubiquitous. VLSI facilitated the fabrication of chips. A chip is a small piece of semiconductor material (usually silicon) containing integrated circuits. These circuits consist of millions or even billions of tiny switches called transistors and other electronic components that process information and perform various functions. These chips are the brains behind countless electronic devices, from smartphones and computers to cars and medical equipment.

One class of chips is called ASIC. ASIC is a type of chip custom-designed for a specific purpose, unlike general-purpose chips like microprocessors that can be used for various tasks. One of the most prominent examples of ASIC is smartphone processors. These chips are custom-designed for mobile devices, focusing on low power consumption and high performance for running apps, gaming, and streaming media. They often incorporate specialized cores for graphics processing, artificial intelligence, and image signal processing.

Designing an ASIC is a complex and fascinating process that entails various steps, from idea to the fabrication data. This process is filled with engineering challenges that require expertise and attention to detail. The entire process requires significant expertise and experience in chip design and can take several months to complete. The ASIC design flow is crucial to ensure successful ASIC design. It is based on a comprehensive understanding of ASIC specifications, requirements, low-power design, and performance. Engineers can streamline the process and meet crucial time-to-market goals by following a proven ASIC design flow. Each stage of the ASIC design cycle is supported by powerful EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools that facilitate the implementation of the design. The following are examples of steps needed to realize an ASIC.

**Design Entry:** In this step, the logic design is described using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) like System Verilog. Typically, the description is done at the data flow (Register Transfer) or behavioral levels.

**Functional Verification:** It is essential to catch design errors early on. The description must be checked against the requirements, which can be done through simulation or formal methods. Functional verification is performed on the RTL description as well as the netlists generated by the following steps.

**Synthesis:** In this step, the HDL description is converted into a circuit of the logic cells called the Netlist.

**Layout/Physical Synthesis:** Also called Physical Implementation. In this step, the logic circuit is converted into a layout of the photo masks used for fabrication. This complex step involves several sub-steps typically automated using its flow. These steps include Floorplanning, Placement, Clock-tree synthesis and Routing. Because Placement and Routing are the most time-consuming operations, sometimes we refer to this step as ‚ÄúPlacement and Routing‚Äù, or PnR.

**Signoff:** marks the final stage in the rigorous journey of an ASIC‚Äôs design; it ensures your creation functions flawlessly, operates efficiently, and ultimately delivers on its promise before sending your chip blueprint off to be carved in silicon.

Please note that the `five mentioned steps` are the major ones. There are several other design steps that are not mentioned here such as scan chain insertion and test pattern generations that are essential to testing the fabricated chip against fabrication defects.

### `OpenLane ASIC Flow`

The OpenLane flow is an automated, open-source framework designed to convert RTL designs into manufacturable layouts, integrating multiple stages of the digital IC design process. Starting with RTL synthesis using Yosys and ABC, the flow performs static timing analysis (STA) with OpenSTA and incorporates Design for Testability (DFT) to ensure fault coverage. The OpenROAD App facilitates floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), optimization, and global routing, streamlining the physical design process. Custom scripts handle antenna diode insertion, while Yosys performs Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) to verify design integrity. TritonRoute manages detailed routing, ensuring signal integrity and minimizing congestion. RC extraction is conducted using DEF2SPEF, followed by STA to confirm timing compliance. Magic and Netgen are employed for physical verification, including Design Rule Checking (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) checks, ensuring the design adheres to manufacturing constraints. The final output is a GDSII/LEF file, ready for fabrication, supported by the SW PDK which provides technology-specific data and libraries. This comprehensive flow enables efficient design exploration and optimization, leveraging open-source tools to deliver high-quality, manufacturable designs.

### üìä **Calculation of Flop Ratio and DFF %**

To evaluate the sequential logic content in the synthesized design:

- **Total Cells** = 15134  
- **DFF Cells** = 1613 (from `sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_2`)

#### ‚û§ Flop Ratio:

Flop Ratio = DFFs / Total Cells = 1613 / 15134 ‚âà 0.1065

#### ‚û§ DFF Percentage:

DFF % = (DFFs / Total Cells) √ó 100 = (1613 / 15134) √ó 100 ‚âà 10.65%

### `Floorplanning and library cells`

Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio: In IC floor planning, utilization factor and aspect ratio are key parameters. The utilization factor is the ratio of the area occupied by the netlist to the total core area. While a perfect utilization of 1 (100%) is ideal, practical designs target a factor of 0.5 to 0.6 to allow space for buffer zones, routing channels, and future adjustments. The aspect ratio, defined as height divided by width, indicates the chip‚Äôs shape; an aspect ratio of 1 denotes a square, while other values result in a rectangular layout. The aspect ratio is chosen based on functional, packaging, and manufacturing needs.

```shell
Utilisation Factor =  Area occupied by netlist
                     __________________________
                         Total area of core
                         

Aspect Ratio =  Height
               ________
                Width
```

**Pre-placed cells :** Pre-placed cells are essential functional blocks, such as memory, custom processors, and analog circuits, positioned manually in fixed locations. These blocks are crucial for the chip‚Äôs performance and remain fixed during placement and routing to preserve their functionality and layout integrity.

**Decoupling Capacitors :** Decoupling capacitors are placed near logic circuits to stabilize power supply voltages during transient events. Acting as local energy reserves, they help reduce voltage fluctuations, crosstalk, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), ensuring reliable power delivery to sensitive circuits.

**Power Planning:** A robust power planning strategy includes creating a power and ground mesh to distribute VDD and VSS evenly across the chip. This setup ensures stable power delivery, minimizes voltage drops, and improves overall efficiency. Multiple power and ground points reduce the risk of instability and voltage drop issues, supporting the design‚Äôs power needs effectively.

**Pin Placement:** Pin placement (I/O planning) is crucial for functionality and reliability. Strategic pin assignment minimizes signal degradation, preserves data integrity, and helps manage heat dissipation. Proper positioning of power and ground pins supports thermal management and enhances signal strength, contributing to overall system stability and manufacturability.

#### Step 8: Floorplaning using OpenLANE & view in Magic

```shell
run_floorplan
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Errors During Floorplanning**

When running:

```shell
run_floorplan
```
you may encounter errors, especially for macro-less designs like picorv32a. These errors are typically due to macro_placement steps within the OpenROAD flow that expect macros to be present in the design.

üß© **Why the Error Occurs?**
The script or_basic_mp.tcl, which handles macro placement, assumes that the design contains macros (like SRAMs or IPs). If no such macros are present, OpenROAD may crash or throw errors during this step:
```shell
macro_placement -global_config glb.cfg
```
For designs without any macros, this command should be skipped to avoid unnecessary failures.

üõ†Ô∏è **How to Fix It?**
You need to modify the or_basic_mp.tcl script to check whether the design contains macros, and only run macro_placement if macros are found.

‚úÖ This change ensures macro placement is only performed when necessary.

Replace the contents of:
```shell
/openLANE_flow/scripts/openroad/or_basic_mp.tcl
```

#### Step 9: Viewing the Floorplan DEF in Magic

To visually inspect the floorplan (DEF) file in the Magic layout editor, use the following command in your terminal from the floorplan results directory:

```shell
magic -T ~/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

![Alt Text](Images/miss6.jpg)

- Press s and v to fit the layout properly on the screen.

- Move the cursor onto a particular object and then press s.

- Go to the tkcon main window.

- Type the command shown in the screenshot (or observe the details displayed).

- The tkcon window will show the details of the selected object.

#### Step 10: Calculate the die area in microns from the values in floorplan def

![Alt Text](Images/def.jpg)

According to floorplan def

```math
1000\ Unit\ Distance = 1\ Micron
```
```math
Die\ width\ in\ unit\ distance = 662810 - 0 = 662810
```
```math
Die\ height\ in\ unit\ distance = 673530 - 0 = 673530
```
```math
Distance\ in\ microns = \frac{Value\ in\ Unit\ Distance}{1000}
```
```math
Die\ width\ in\ microns = \frac{662810}{1000} = 662.810\ Microns
```
```math
Die\ height\ in\ microns = \frac{673530}{1000} = 673.530\ Microns
```
```math
Area\ of\ die\ in\ microns = 662.81 * 673.53 = 446422.4193\ Square\ Microns
```

#### Step 11: Run Placement using OpenLANE

After successful floorplanning, the next major step in the digital backend flow is cell placement. This stage involves arranging the standard cells within the defined core area while minimizing congestion, wire length, and optimizing performance metrics like timing and power.

To initiate placement:
```shell
run_placement
```

#### Step 12: Viewing the Placement DEF in Magic

```shell
magic -T ~/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &
```

### Viewing the Placement PNG Output

After running the placement step (`run_placement`), a visualization of the placed standard cells is automatically generated.

üìÅ You can find this file in the placement results directory:

To open this PNG file from the terminal (inside the appropriate directory), use:

```bash
xdg-open picorv32a.placement.def.png
```
