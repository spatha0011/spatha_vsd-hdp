### <ins>What is Routing?</ins>

Routing is the process of creating **physical electrical connections** between standard cells, macros, and I/O pins using **metal layers and vias**. It transforms the logical connections (netlist) into actual wires on silicon after placement and Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS). This is a crucial step that directly impacts the chipâ€™s **functionality**, **timing**, **signal integrity**, and **manufacturability**.

### <ins>Goals of Routing</ins>

- Establish all **signal connections** defined in the netlist.
- Avoid **DRC (Design Rule Check)** violations.
- Minimize **routing congestion** and **via count**.
- Improve **timing performance** by optimizing critical paths.
- Ensure **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)** and **Signal Integrity** compliance.
- Maintain clear separation of **signal** and **power/ground** routing.

### <ins>Steps in Routing Flow</ins>

1. **Global Routing**  
   - Divides the layout into coarse grid cells.
   - Assigns rough paths for nets avoiding congestion and blockages.
   - Steers clear of P/G routes and macro blockages.

2. **Track Assignment (TA)**  
   - Maps each net to specific routing tracks.
   - Optimizes for fewer vias and longer straight segments.
   - Physical DRCs are not enforced yet.

3. **Detail Routing**  
   - Finalizes exact wire geometry and vias.
   - Fixes DRC violations (spacing, width, enclosure, etc.).
   - Performs timing-aware optimizations.

> âœ… **Result**: A DRC-clean, fully-connected layout ready for parasitic extraction and timing signoff.

### <ins>TritonRoute</ins>

TritonRoute performs detailed routing by utilizing pre-generated global routing guides and applying a **MILP-based panel routing** strategy. It supports intra-layer parallel routing, where multiple regions within the same metal layer are routed simultaneously, and inter-layer sequential routing, which processes metal layers one after the other from lower to higher levels. TritonRoute adheres to each metal layerâ€™s preferred routing direction as specified in the LEF file (e.g., Metal1: horizontal, Metal2: vertical), helping reduce wire congestion, minimize parasitic capacitance, and enhance overall signal integrity.

#### Features:

TritonRoute uses **pre-processed route guides** generated by the global router. These guides serve as high-level blueprints for the detailed routing stage. By following these predefined paths, TritonRoute enhances routing efficiency and quality.

The preprocessing involves:

- **(a)** Initial route guides based on pin locations (e.g., A to B),
- **(b)** Splitting wide segments into unit-width segments aligned with preferred directions,
- **(c)** Merging overlapping or redundant segments,
- **(d)** Bridging between layers (e.g., from M1 to M2),
- **(e)** Final preprocessed guides optimized for detailed routing.

**Preferred Routing Directions**:
- **M1 (Metal1)**: Vertical
- **M2 (Metal2)**: Horizontal

These guides help TritonRoute:
- Follow preferred routing directions,
- Reduce congestion and via usage,
- Maintain DRC-clean, high-quality routing.

**Requirements of Pre-processed Guides:**
- Must be of **unit width**.
- Must follow the **preferred direction** for each metal layer.

In TritonRoute, **inter-guide connectivity** ensures seamless routing between adjacent or overlapping route guides. This feature is essential for maintaining electrical continuity across guide boundaries, allowing signal paths to flow without interruption.

Two route guides are considered connected if:
- They lie on the **same metal layer** and share **touching edges**, or
- They are on **adjacent metal layers** and have a **non-zero vertical overlap** area.

Additionally:
- Each **unconnected terminal** (i.e., a pin of a standard-cell instance) must be **overlapped by at least one route guide** to ensure proper routing access.

This connectivity mechanism helps:
- Reduce routing discontinuities,
- Eliminate open connections,
- Improve the reliability and routability of the physical design.

The **Routing Topology Algorithm** is crucial for defining the connection structure between pins in an integrated circuit. It determines the most efficient and cost-effective way to route nets by analyzing the relative positions of pins (also known as Access Points for Connections â€” APCs).

#### Key Steps:
1. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Compute pairwise distances between all pin access points.
   - `cost(i, j) = dist(APC_i, APC_j)` for each pair `(i, j)`.

2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
   - Use the distance cost matrix to generate a **Minimum Spanning Tree** over the pin set.
   - The MST minimizes total routing wirelength while maintaining full connectivity.

3. **Topology Extraction**:
   - Return the set of edges (connections) in the MST as the optimal routing topology.
