# VSD Hardware Design Program

## VSDBabySoC post_route SPEF generation

This section covers the step-by-step procedure to generate the **post-route Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF)** and **post-placement Verilog netlist** for the `VSDBabySoC` design using OpenROAD. These outputs are essential for accurate timing analysis and signoff after the routing stage. The SPEF file captures parasitic RC effects from the physical layout, while the updated Verilog reflects the final net connections post-placement and routing.

### Step 1: Launch OpenROAD

Before starting OpenROAD, set up the environment and navigate to the flow directory:

```bash
cd ~/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
source env.sh
cd flow/
openroad
```

### Step 2: Load Design and Technology Files

Once inside the OpenROAD shell, run the following commands in sequence to load the required design and technology data for VSDBabySoC:

These files describe the physical dimensions and metal/via layers for standard cells and macros:
```shell
read_lef /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/lef/sky130hd.lef
read_lef /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/lef/avsdpll.lef
read_lef /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/lef/avsddac.lef
```

This file contains timing and power data for the standard cells:
```shell
read_liberty /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/platforms/sky130hd/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

The DEF file represents the post-route physical layout of the design:
```shell
read_def /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/base/5_route.def
```

### **Step 3: RC Extraction and Output Generation**

After loading the LEF, Liberty, and DEF files, run the following commands to define the process corner and extract parasitics using the available `.calibre`-format model:

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. Define Process Corner
Set the process corner using the available Calibre-based extraction rules file:

```tcl
define_process_corner -ext_model_index 0 /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/external-resources/open_pdks/sky130/openlane/rules.openrcx.sky130A.nom.calibre
```

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. Extract Parasitics

Run parasitic extraction using the same file:

```shell
extract_parasitics -ext_model_file /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/external-resources/open_pdks/sky130/openlane/rules.openrcx.sky130A.nom.calibre
```

#### ðŸ”¹ 3. Write SPEF File
Save the extracted parasitics:

```shell
write_spef /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/vsdbabysoc.spef
```

#### ðŸ”¹ 4. Write Post-Placement Verilog Netlist
Save the netlist after placement and routing:

```shell
write_verilog /home/spatha/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/designs/sky130hd/vsdbabysoc/vsdbabysoc_post_place.v
```
