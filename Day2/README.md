##  Liberty Format

Liberty format is an industry standard format used to describe library cells of a particular technology. A cell could be a standard cell, IO buffer, complex IP, etc. Library cell description contains a lot of information like timing information, power estimation, and several other attributes like area, functionality, and operating conditions. Speaking more technically, Liberty format is a format to represent timing and power properties of black boxes (which we can't descend into). Liberty is an ASCII format, usually represented in a text file with the extension `.lib`.

The information inside the Lib file can be divided into two main parts, in the first part, it contains some information which is common for all the standard cells. To understand it better have a look in the following snapshot of the Lib file.

![Alt Text](Images/1.png)

The common part of Lib file contains
Library name and technology name
Units (of time, power, voltage, current, resistance and capacitance)
Value of operating condition ( process, voltage and temperature) â€“ Max, Min and Typical 

Based on operating conditions there are three different lib files for Max, Min and Typical corners. 

In the second part of Lib file, it contains cell-specific information for each cell. The part of Lib file which contains cell-specific information is shown below.

## Standard Cell Example: `a2111o_1`

The cell `a2111o_1` from the `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib` library implements the following logic:

X = ((A1 & A2) | B1 | C1 | D1)

## Standard Cell Comparison: `and2_1`, `and2_2`, and `and2_4`

This section compares three variants of the 2-input AND gate from the `sky130_fd_sc_hd` library:
- `and2_1`
- `and2_2`
- `and2_4`

## Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis (Yosys)
A Hierarchical Design contains of multiple sub-modules,instantiated in the 'top' module. 

Hierachical design approach is taken for large designs, to gain the advantage of divide and conquer approach. This leads to better utilization of tool resources for proper optimzation of smaller designs,as a larger design is difficult for a tool to optimize efficiently.

It helps in better utilization of compute resources utilized during design process,and also leads to faster runtime and debugging operations.

A flat design approach is chosen when the design is sufficiently small enough for the tool to optimize efficiently in a reasonable amount of time.

For small and simple ASICs flat approach is preferable while hierarchical approach is preferable for larger,complex ASICs.

### Design : multiple_modules.v

![Alt Text](Images/6.png)

### Hierarchical Flow:
```bash
yosys
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top multiple_modules
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show multiple_modules
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules.v
```

It Preserves module hierarchy:

Top: multiple_modules

Submodules: sub_module1, sub_module2

### Flattened Flow:
A flat design is a representation where all hierarchical module structures are collapsed into a single level, eliminating submodules and integrating their logic directly into the top-level module.

No submodules are preserved.

```bash
flatten
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v
```

### Why Do We Use Flops? (To Avoid Glitches)
Combinational circuits can produce glitches â€” short, unwanted changes in output â€” when the inputs change at slightly different times. This happens because the logic takes a little time to settle when multiple signals arrive with different delays.

These glitches can cause problems, especially if they are captured by other parts of the circuit.

To solve this, we insert flip-flops between combinational blocks. Flip-flops are edge-sensitive, which means they only capture data at a specific moment (like the rising edge of a clock). This helps ensure that only stable, correct data is passed forward, and any glitches that happened before the clock edge are ignored.

## D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset

This module defines a D Flip-Flop with an asynchronous reset. It captures the input d on the rising edge of the clock, unless the asynchronous reset is activated.

![Alt Text](Images/9.png)

In the dff_asyncres module, the asynchronous reset has higher priority than the clock.

async_reset is checked first, so if it is high (1), it immediately resets q to 0.

The clock (clk) only matters when async_reset is low (inactive).

![Alt Text](Images/15.png)

## D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous set

This module defines a D Flip-Flop with an asynchronous set. It captures input d on the rising edge of the clock, unless the asynchronous set is active.

![Alt Text](Images/10.png)

The flip-flop responds to either the positive edge of clk or async_set.

If async_set is high, the output q is immediately set to 1, regardless of the clock.

If async_set is low (inactive), then q takes the value of d on the rising edge of the clock.

## D Flip-Flop with Synchronous Reset

This module defines a D Flip-Flop with a synchronous reset. The flip-flop captures the value of d on the rising edge of the clock, unless the synchronous reset is active.

![Alt Text](Images/11.png)

The always block triggers only on the rising edge of the clock.

If sync_reset is high at the time of the clock edge, the output q is set to 0.

If sync_reset is low, the output q is updated with the input d.

## D Flip-Flop with Both Asynchronous and Synchronous Reset

This design supports both asynchronous and synchronous reset behavior.

Asynchronous reset has higher priority and takes effect immediately, while synchronous reset is evaluated at the clock edge.

## Synthesis of D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous set

```bash

show
```

#### Note:
abc -liberty <.lib file path> : This command is used for for technology mapping of yosysâ€™s internal gate library to a target architecture.

synth -top <module_name> : This command runs the yosys synthesis script on the mentioned module name of our design

dfflibmap -liberty <.lib file path> : This command maps internal flipflop cells to the flipflop cells in the technology library specified in the given liberty file.

## Interesting optimisations

Optimization in synthesis refers to simplifying the RTL logic to make the design more efficient. In the below examples, you can see that the Yosys removes redundant logic, simplifies expressions, and reduces gate count without changing functionality.
