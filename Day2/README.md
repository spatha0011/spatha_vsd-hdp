## Day 2 : Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

## Liberty Format

Liberty format is an industry standard format used to describe library cells of a particular technology. A cell could be a standard cell, IO buffer, complex IP, etc. Library cell description contains a lot of information like timing information, power estimation, and several other attributes like area, functionality, and operating conditions. Speaking more technically, Liberty format is a format to represent timing and power properties of black boxes (which we can't descend into). Liberty is an ASCII format, usually represented in a text file with the extension `.lib`.
