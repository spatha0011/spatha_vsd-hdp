## Static Behavior Evaluation: CMOS Inverter Robustness and Noise Margin

### `Introduction to noise margin`

Noise margin is the maximum noise voltage a CMOS circuit can tolerate without logic errors.

This image compares:

**Ideal I/O characteristic** of an inverter with **infinite slope** â€” abrupt switching at `Vdd/2` (left side)

**Actual inverter characteristic** with **finite slope** â€” gradual transition region (right side)

### `Noise Margin Definition â€” VTC and Undefined Region`

This figure illustrates how **Noise Margin** is derived from the **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter.

âœ… The left plot shows:

- The slope of the VTC = **âˆ’1** at two critical points:
  - `VIL`: Input Low Threshold Voltage
  - `VIH`: Input High Threshold Voltage

âœ… The right diagram shows:

- **VOH** and **VOL**: Valid output high/low voltage levels
- **VIL** and **VIH**: Input thresholds where the slope = âˆ’1

âœ… **Noise Margins**:

- `NMH = VOH âˆ’ VIH`: Noise Margin High â€” tolerance for noise on logic 1
- `NML = VIL âˆ’ VOL`: Noise Margin Low â€” tolerance for noise on logic 0

âœ… **Undefined Region**:

- Between `VIL` and `VIH`, the logic level is undefined.
- Any input noise in this region can cause unstable or invalid output.
- Designers aim to **maximize NMH/NML** to improve circuit robustness.

 Noise margins quantify how much noise a logic signal can tolerate before causing errors â€” ensuring **reliable logic levels** in noisy environments.

### `Noise Margin Summary â€” Handling Input "Bumps"`

This figure summarizes how **Noise Margins** help handle noisy "bumps" on signals â€” ensuring correct logic detection.

âœ… **Input thresholds**:

- `VIL`: Input voltage < Vdd/2 (~10% of Vdd) â€” treated as **logic '0'**
- `VIH`: Input voltage > Vdd/2 (~90% of Vdd) â€” treated as **logic '1'**

âœ… **Output thresholds**:

- `VOL`: Output voltage near 0V â€” treated as **logic '0'** for next gate input
- `VOH`: Output voltage near Vdd â€” treated as **logic '1'** for next gate input

âœ… **Noise bump scenarios**:

- **Case (a)**:  
  Bump height lies between `VOL` and `VIL` â†’ signal still treated as **logic '0'**.
  
- **Case (b)**:  
  Bump height lies between `VIL` and `VIH` â†’ output becomes **undefined** (logic unstable).
  
- **Case (c)**:  
  Bump height lies between `VIH` and `VOH` â†’ signal treated as **logic '1'**.

For any signal to be reliably interpreted as **logic '0'** or **logic '1'**, it must stay within the corresponding **Noise Margin (NML or NMH)** range â€” outside the **undefined region**.
