**OpenROAD** is an open-source, fully automated RTL-to-GDSII flow for digital integrated circuit (IC) design. It supports synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and final layout generation. OpenROAD enables rapid design iterations, making it ideal for academic research and industry prototyping.

### `Steps to Install OpenROAD and Run GUI`

### 1. Clone the OpenROAD Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```
