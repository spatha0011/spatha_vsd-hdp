### `Static behaviour evaluation-CMOS inverter robustness-Power supply variation`

**Overview:**

Power supply scaling directly affects the **static behavior** of a CMOS inverter ‚Äî changing its switching threshold (Vm), noise margins, and overall robustness.

**SPICE Simulation:**

- The CMOS inverter is simulated at two different supply voltages:  
  `Vdd = 2.5V` ‚Üí scaled down to `Vdd = 1V`
- PMOS and NMOS sizes remain constant:  
  - `Wp = 0.9375 Œºm`, `Wn = 0.375 Œºm`

‚úÖ **Switching Threshold (Vm)**:  
As `Vdd` decreases, the inverter's switching threshold **Vm** tends to move toward the center of the supply range ‚Äî but noise margins shrink.

‚úÖ **Noise Margins**:  
Lower `Vdd` ‚Üí reduced noise immunity ‚Üí circuit becomes more sensitive to noise and supply variations.

‚úÖ **Performance Impact**:  
Low `Vdd` operation reduces static and dynamic power ‚Äî but limits noise robustness.  
High `Vdd` improves noise margin, but increases power dissipation.

While power scaling is essential for low-power design, it introduces trade-offs in noise margin and reliability ‚Äî requiring careful balancing in circuit design.

This plot illustrates how the **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter shift with **different power supply levels (Vdd scaling)** ‚Äî showing progressive reduction in noise margins as Vdd decreases.

**Advantages of using 0.5V supply:**

Using **lower Vdd (0.5V)** provides benefits like **~50% gain improvement** and **~90% reduction in energy consumption**, demonstrating the efficiency of power supply scaling in CMOS inverters.

**Disadvantage of using 0.5V supply**:

- While lowering Vdd improves gain and energy efficiency, it introduces **performance impact** ‚Äî circuits may switch slower due to reduced drive strength.

ü§î**How to Calculate Gain from SPICE VTC Plot??**

To calculate the gain of the CMOS inverter from the Voltage Transfer Characteristics:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Click on PMOS slope** (left side of transition) ‚Äî Terminal displays:  
`x0 = Vin`, `y0 = Vout`

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Click on NMOS slope** (right side of transition) ‚Äî Terminal displays:  
`x1 = Vin`, `y1 = Vout`

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Compute Gain**:

Gain = (y0 ‚àí y1) / (x0 ‚àí x1)
