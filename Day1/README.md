## Day 1 : Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

### Simulator
RTL design is validated by simulating its behavior to ensure it adheres to the specifications.

The simulator used for this course is Icarus Verilog (iverilog).

### Design
The design consists of Verilog code implementing the intended hardware logic.

It should meet functional specifications and can be composed of one or more Verilog modules.

### Testbench
A testbench is used to apply test vectors (stimuli) to the design.

It mimics input signals and observes the response to verify design correctness.

Note: The testbench does not have primary inputs or outputs.

### How the Simulator Works
The simulator continuously checks for changes in input signals.

If there is a change, it evaluates the corresponding output.

If no change occurs in inputs â†’ no change in outputs.

The simulator focuses solely on detecting and reacting to signal changes.
