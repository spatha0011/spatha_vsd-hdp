# VSD Hardware Design Program

## Day 1 : Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

### Simulator
RTL design is validated by simulating its behavior to ensure it adheres to the specifications.

The simulator used for this course is Icarus Verilog (iverilog).

### Design
The design consists of Verilog code implementing the intended hardware logic.

It should meet functional specifications and can be composed of one or more Verilog modules.

### Testbench
A testbench is used to apply test vectors (stimuli) to the design.

It mimics input signals and observes the response to verify design correctness.

<strong>Note:</strong> The testbench does not have primary inputs or outputs.

### How the Simulator Works
The simulator continuously checks for changes in input signals.

If there is a change, it evaluates the corresponding output.

If no change occurs in inputs â†’ no change in outputs.

The simulator focuses solely on detecting and reacting to signal changes.

### `Iverilog-Based Simulation Flow`

The Iverilog-based simulation flow begins with writing the Design (RTL Verilog module) and a corresponding Testbench that applies input vectors to the design and observes the outputs. Both files are compiled using the iverilog tool to generate a simulation executable. When this executable is run, it produces a Value Change Dump (VCD) file that records signal transitions over time. This VCD file is then viewed using gtkwave, a waveform viewer that allows designers to analyze and debug signal behavior visually, ensuring the design meets the expected functionality.

### `File Structure: MUX 2:1 Design and Testbench`

To simulate and verify a 2:1 multiplexer, we use two main Verilog files: the design file and the testbench file.

### Design (`good_mux.v`)
- Implements a 2:1 multiplexer using behavioral Verilog with inputs `i0`, `i1`, `sel` and output `y`.
- Uses an `always @(*)` block with an `if-else` construct to select between `i0` and `i1` based on the value of `sel`.

### Testbench (`tb_good_mux.v`)
- Instantiates the `good_mux` module and applies stimulus through internal registers `i0`, `i1`, and `sel`.
- Generates a VCD waveform file using `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` for output signal observation via gtkwave.
