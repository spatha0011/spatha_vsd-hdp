## Day 3 : Combinational and sequential optmizations


### Combinational Logic Optimisation

#### Objective:
Squeeze and simplify logic to get the most optimized design in terms of **area** and **power**.

#### Techniques:

- **Constant Propagation**
  - Replaces logic blocks with constants when input values are fixed.
  - **Example:**
    ```
    Y = ((A·B) + C)' 
    If A = 0 → Y = (0 + C)' = C'
    ```
  - **Result:** Complex gate logic (6 MOS transistors) simplifies to a single inverter (2 MOS transistors).

- **Boolean Logic Optimisation**
  - Simplify Boolean expressions using:
    - Karnaugh Map (K-Map)
    - Quine McCluskey Method
  - **Example Verilog:**
    ```verilog
    assign y = a ? (b ? c : (c ? a : 0)) : (!c);
    ```
    - Optimized expression:  
      ```
      y = a ⊕ c
      ```

### Sequential Logic Optimisation

#### Basic:
- **Sequential Constant Propagation**  
  - Propagates known constant values through flip-flops during synthesis.

#### Advanced :
- **State Optimization**
  - Reduces the number of states in FSMs to optimize area and transitions.
- **Retiming**
  - Moves registers across logic boundaries to balance delay and improve timing.
- **Sequential Logic Cloning**
  - Duplicates logic in floorplan-aware synthesis to meet timing and congestion goals.
